# PyBerAnalysis
An analysis of a Python-powered rideshare company's driver and city data.

## Overview
As a new data analyst at Pyber, my first task was to use the matplotlib and pandas libraries of python to analyze and illustrate the relationships between the type of city (urban, suburban and rural) and the number of drivers, the number of riders, and the amount of fares. After completing that initial analysis, V. Isualize tasked me with creating a dataframe that summarizes the differences between the three city types in terms of the number of rides, the number of drivers and the total fares as well as the average fares per ride and average fares per driver. The company will then use this data to improve access and affordability in underserved areas. Below are the results of my analysis as well as recommendations for the company
