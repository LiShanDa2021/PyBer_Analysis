# PyBerAnalysis
An analysis of a Python-powered rideshare company's driver and city data.

## Overview
As a new data analyst at Pyber, my first task was to use the matplotlib and pandas libraries of python to analyze and illustrate the relationships between the type of city (urban, suburban and rural) and the number of drivers, the number of riders, and the amount of fares. After completing that initial analysis, V. Isualize gave me two tasks. First I created a dataframe that summarizes the differences between the three city types in terms of the number of rides, the number of drivers and the total fares as well as the average fares per ride and average fares per driver. Then, I created a plot that charts the total weekly fares by city type. The company will then use this data to improve access and affordability in underserved areas. Below are the results of my analysis as well as recommendations for the company.


## Results

From the summary dataframe below, the differences between urban cities and other cities are stark.

As you can see, suburban and rural riders pay 6 and and 10 dollars more on average per ride than do urban riders. Being a rural Pyber driver, however, is a much better deal. Drivers in rural areas make significantly more per ride than do suburban and urban drivers, and with 1.6 rides per driver they have more chances to get fares than urban (1.48 rides per driver) and suburban (1.28 rides per driver) drivers. The suburbs are not ideal for either drivers or riders. Suburban riders pay significantly more than urban riders while urban drivers make less than rural drivers and have fewer chances to earn fares.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.



## Summary
